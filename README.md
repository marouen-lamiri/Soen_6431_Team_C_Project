## Project Description
Json-iterator: “jsoniter (json-iterator) is fast and flexible JSON parser available in Java and Go.”It provides various APIs for serialisation and deserialisation of objects and is available for Go and Java. Whereas, the current document concentrates on the latter. Three most significant APIs, which can be mixed and matched to get desired results, are:
- Iterator-api
- Bind-api
- Any-api

We will perform maintainance on this project and fix software undesirables that are still present for the SOEN_6431 course.
